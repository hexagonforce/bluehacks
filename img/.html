            <h1>The Groupmate Theory: Weird and the Normal (Part 2)</h1>
<p class="meta">15 Oct 2017</p>

<div class="post">
    <p>Hi. This is the second part of my translation of the wonderful 
“Groupmates” section of the Namu Wiki article “Group Projects”. This one
 is going to talk about the Weird and the Normal types of groupmates 
which you would almost always encounter.</p>

<h1 id="esoteric-but-not-necessarily-bad">Esoteric but not necessarily bad</h1>
<h2 id="the-lazy-genius">The Lazy Genius</h2>
<p>The case when a person is waaay beyond competent but are very lazy.</p>

<p>These people usually do something else when others debate and work 
with the project. So people who don’t recognize a Lazy Genius might view
 him or her as freeloaders or plainly lazy people. Even when he/she is 
reporting he’s very lax and chill, so other members might question the 
attitude of this guy.</p>

<p>Of course, their abilities show through their results. Doesn’t show 
up to meetings, looks at the presentations on the day itself, presents 
based on background knowledge, gets A+. In debates, they just take a 
look at the topic and completely wrecks the other side, or solves a 
problem that three people worked on for 30 minutes with one suggestion.</p>

<p>For these people, their concept of “common knowledge” is different 
from the normal “common knowledge”. For other people, these things are 
really difficult things that needs to be researched for hours on the 
internet. But for these people, it’s “Do I necessarily have to research 
this?” so they find prep time for presentations a waste. When they don’t
 pay attention to meetings, they’re basically saying “LOL what an easy 
problem, what’s the matter with them…”</p>

<p>Since the results are good no one can really attack their lack of 
participation. He can just say “dude I carried and we got a good score 
right?” and no one can really say anything.</p>

<p>To use these people well, give them two peoples’ worth of work and 
give him an “assistant” who’s job it is to ‘do the dirty work’ and ‘to 
keep the Lazy Genius in check’. Then they can show great ability better 
than a well trained corporal in the military. Do not make lazy geniuses 
leaders because leaders have to take care of a lot of menial things but 
these people are lazy.</p>

<h2 id="members-with-connections">Members with Connections</h2>
<p>These people know other people who are experts at their majors. This 
happens more often in Archi or Engineeringg courses or the Arts. These 
people can just ask for materials from their connections so people w/o 
connections would obviously be at a disadvantage. It feels very unfair 
when this type of member says “That’s all you can do?”, “You gotta try 
harder”, or “Can you please get out of our group?” just because you 
don’t have connections. Yeah, they got connections, but the question is 
do they have actual skill?. And it’s bearable if the member actually got
 good materials, but if he/she keeps trash-talking but the results are 
bad…</p>

<p>In law or business sometimes the prof asks you to interview lawyers 
or high-ranking officials from big companies. It’s like they’re testing 
your connections and not your ability. Even if you say that you don’t 
have connections, the prof would just cut with “Try harder, if you try 
hard enough you’d find one”. So the tasks ends with either paying a 
lawyer in the neighborhood or getting a bad grade. This happens because 
the prof’s standard of his friends makes him think that “You’d know at 
least one lawyer or officer in your life”. Of course, that’s not true 
for most other people. However, if your parents have connections then 
you can do these things well enough.</p>

<h1 id="normal-members">Normal members</h1>
<h2 id="half-forced-solo-carry">Half-forced Solo-Carry</h2>
<p>Unlike voluntary solo-carries, these people were forced to solo-carry
 a group project. Most people who complain about group works are in this
 type.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there’s a 5 member group project but two people withdrew the class. If it’s only the first few days of the work, you <em>could</em> move somewhere else; however, if it’s already halfway through you’re forced to carry on with lacking members.</li>
  <li>Due to circumstance or personality, other members quietly force the one person to solo-carry.
Of course, the quality of the work would deteriorate in this case because the carry was <em>forced</em>
 to carry. Unfortunately, most professors don’t actually check 
participation in the groups, and peer reviewing will always end up with 
high scores for everyone (…) therefore it really sucks to be a 
half-forced Solo-carry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-quiet-member">The quiet member</h2>
<p>This type of member aren’t very active, but they receive orders and 
do them well. Although there are quiet members who are actually good at 
their work, some of them are just hard-working without much ability(…). 
At least these types are better than freeloaders. But they have little 
to no impact in the group.</p>

<p>Most quiet members produce decent output unless very unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="me-myself-and-i">Me, Myself, and I</h2>
<p>This type of members are similar to Solo-Carries but they <strong>never do more than their assigned work</strong>. They might be good at their work, but they <em>refuse</em>
 anyone who tries to give them more work. This is why they tend to be 
viewed as uncooperative, and even if they do well, if the rest of the 
members suck, the entire thing collapses. At least they’re not 
freeloaders.</p>

<p>But if everyone in a group is of this type, that group fails. No exceptions.</p>

<h2 id="everyone-else-is-too-good-for-me">Everyone else is too good for me</h2>
<p>This situation (not really a type) occurs when good and bad 
groupmates are obviously defined. Say there are two 4th year cum laude 
students and some normal 1st year students. The latter will never reach 
the standards of the former. These people are sometimes relegated to 
doing menial tasks but that might as well be the best choice because 
when this type of groupmate is given important work, either the work 
turns out to be bad or the person in question crumbles to pressure.</p>
